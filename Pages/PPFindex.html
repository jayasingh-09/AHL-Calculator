                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>If you're looking to save for the future in a <strong>risk-free</strong> manner, a <strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</strong> account is a great option. The PPF offers guaranteed returns, making it an attractive investment for <strong>new employees</strong>, <strong>parents</strong> planning for their children's future, or anyone aiming to build savings over time. Calculating the returns on your PPF account can be tricky, but with the right tools, you can easily figure out how much you will earn. One such tool is the <strong>PPF calculator</strong>, which helps you compute interest and returns accurately.</p>

                    <h3>What is a PPF Account?</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>Public Provident Fund (PPF)</strong> account is a long-term savings scheme offered by the government of India that provides attractive interest rates and tax benefits. This government-backed savings option encourages individuals to invest for the future in a <strong>risk-free</strong> manner. PPF accounts are commonly offered by banks like <strong>SBI, HDFC, ICICI</strong>, and others, as well as post offices.</p>

                    <h3>How Can the PPF Calculator Help You?</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>PPF calculator</strong> simplifies the process of calculating the maturity amount and interest earned from your PPF account. With this financial tool, you can easily track how much your investment will grow over time, based on different interest rates. The PPF interest rate changes periodically, so using the <strong>PPF calculator</strong> can help you adjust your plans according to current market conditions.</p>
                    <p>Here’s how the <strong>PPF calculator</strong> works: It takes into account factors like the annual contribution, tenure of investment, and applicable interest rates to calculate the maturity amount. You can also use the <strong>PPF interest calculator</strong> to check both monthly and yearly contributions.</p>

                    <h3>PPF Interest Rate and Calculation Formula</h3>
                    <p>The PPF interest rate varies each year, and currently, it is set at 7.1% (subject to change). The interest is compounded annually. The PPF calculator uses the following formula to calculate your returns:</p>
                    <p><strong>F = P [({(1 + i) ^n} - 1) / i]</strong>
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>F</strong> is the maturity amount.</li>
                      <li><strong>P</strong> is the annual deposit amount.</li>
                      <li><strong>i</strong> is the interest rate.</li>
                      <li><strong>n</strong> is the number of years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Example: How to Use the PPF Calculator</h3>
                    <p>Let's assume an individual invests ₹1,50,000 annually in their PPF account for a tenure of 15 years at an interest rate of 7.1%. Using the PPF account calculator, the maturity sum after 15 years will be ₹40,68,209.</p>
                    <p>The table below shows the growth of the investment:</p>
