                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Any employee of a private company that provides EPF facilities is eligible to receive an amount as gratuity after completing 5 years of service. However, an employee is also eligible to get the gratuity before five years if he/she gets injured and disabled in an accident or due to a disease. Groww provides you with a free <strong>gratuity calculator</strong> which you can use and calculate how much your organization owes you. All gratuity payments are controlled by the laws laid down under the Payment of Gratuity Act 1972. The amount depends on the last drawn salary and the years of service served to the company.</p>
                    <p>If you are eligible for payment of gratuity, you must first check how much you are eligible for. Our online gratuity calculator will help you in that aspect too.</p>

                    <h3>Gratuity Calculation Formula</h3>
                    <p>Groww uses a proprietary formula that is benchmarked with other similar offerings. The formula used by our <strong>online gratuity calculator</strong> is:</p>
                    <pre>
    G = n * b * 15 / 26
                    </pre>
                    <p>In the formula, the values are the following:</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Variable</th>
                                <th>Description</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>N/n</td>
                                <td>The number of years you have worked in the concerned organization</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>B/b</td>
                                <td>Last drawn basic salary plus Dearness Allowance (DA)</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>G</td>
                                <td>Gratuity amount you are eligible for</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>For example, if individual A has worked with an organization for 5 years, and your basic salary plus DA amounted to Rs. 30,000 every month, you are eligible to receive:</p>
                    <pre>
    5 * 30,000 * 15 / 26 = Rs. 86,538.46 as gratuity.
                    </pre>
                    <p>Note that under the existing laws:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your gratuity cannot exceed Rs. 10 Lakh in its entirety. Any amount beyond this upper limit is called <strong>ex gratia</strong> payment.</li>
                        <li>Also, if you have worked for, say, 17 years and 6 months, the figure will be rounded off to the nearest single digit or 18 years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How can a Gratuity Calculator Help You?</h3>
