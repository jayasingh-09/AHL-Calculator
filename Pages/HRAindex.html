            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>House Rent Allowance (HRA)</strong> is a key component of
              your salary, helping you manage rental expenses. However, did you
              know that you can also save on taxes with the right
              <strong>HRA tax exemptions</strong>? The HRA amount varies based
              on your salary structure, the actual rent paid, and the city you
              live in. For salaried employees living in rented homes,
              calculating HRA and its associated tax exemptions is crucial. Our
              <strong>HRA calculator</strong> is designed to help you determine
              the tax exemptions you can claim.
            </p>

            <h3>What is an HRA Calculator?</h3>
            <p>
              As the cost of living in many Indian cities continues to rise,
              many organizations provide
              <strong>House Rent Allowance (HRA)</strong> as part of their
              employees' salaries. The <strong>HRA calculator</strong> can help
              you determine the amount of HRA you are eligible for based on your
              salary, the rent you pay, and the city you live in.
            </p>
            <p>
              The HRA slabs in India have been categorized into three distinct
              groups after the 7th Pay Commission recommendations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Slab X:</strong> Most urban cities where the cost of
                living is high.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Slab Y:</strong> Marginally lower-cost cities.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Slab Z:</strong> Smaller cities with relatively lower
                living costs.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How Can the HRA Calculator Help You?</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>HRA exemption calculator</strong> is a useful tool for
              salaried employees who receive HRA as part of their salary. It
              helps calculate the tax-exempt portion of the HRA based on various
              factors. To claim HRA exemptions, the following conditions must be
              met:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Salaried Status:</strong> You must be a salaried
                individual receiving HRA.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Rent Paid:</strong> You should be living in a rented
                accommodation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exceeds 10% of Salary:</strong> The HRA must exceed 10%
                of your basic salary.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Using our <strong>HRA tax exemption calculator</strong>, you can
              determine how much tax you need to pay and how much of your HRA
              can be claimed as an exemption.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Calculate HRA in India?</h3>
            <p>
              Groww’s <strong>HRA calculation tool</strong> follows a standard
              formula to determine the House Rent Allowance payable. The salary
              components considered for the calculation include Basic Salary,
              Dearness Allowance, and other variable commissions. The HRA tax
              exemption is calculated based on the lowest of the following three
              heads:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Actual Rent Paid – 10% of Basic Salary</li>
              <li>HRA Provided by Employer</li>
              <li>40%-50% of Basic Salary, depending on the city.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example of HRA Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              Let’s take a fictional example of Person A, who lives in Delhi and
              pays ₹12,000 in rent every month. Here’s his salary breakdown:
            </p>
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Salary component</th>
                  <th>Total amount (each month)</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Basic Salary</td>
                  <td>₹23,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>HRA</td>
                  <td>₹15,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Conveyance Allowance</td>
                  <td>₹3,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Medical Allowance</td>
                  <td>₹1,250</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Special Allowance</td>
                  <td>₹2,300</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
              Adding the components, we identify that Individual A has a monthly
              salary of ₹44,500.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, using the <strong>HRA exemption calculator</strong>, the
              figures are calculated as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Actual Rent Paid – 10% of Basic: ₹12,000 – ₹2,300 = ₹9,700
              </li>
              <li>HRA Provided by Employer: ₹15,000</li>
              <li>50% of Basic Salary: ₹11,500</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The lowest amount among these three is ₹9,700, so Person A can
              claim ₹9,700 as HRA exemption from his taxable income.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Use the HRA Calculator?</h3>
