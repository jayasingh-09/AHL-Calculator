            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              If you're an employee of a private company in India, you're
              eligible to receive gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act
              1972 after completing five years of service. However, in certain
              circumstances such as injury or disability due to an accident or
              disease, you may be eligible for gratuity even before five years.
              The gratuity amount is calculated based on your last drawn salary,
              including basic salary and Dearness Allowance (DA), and the number
              of years you have worked in the company.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Use the Gratuity Calculator by Ashiana Housing</h3>

            <h3>Gratuity Calculation Formula</h3>
            <p>
              The gratuity calculation formula used by Ashiana Housing’s online
              tool is:
            </p>
            <p><strong>G = n × b × 15 / 26</strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>

                <tr>

              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
              For instance, if you’ve worked for 5 years with a monthly salary
              (including DA) of Rs. 30,000, the gratuity amount would be:
            </p>
            <p><strong>G = 5 × 30,000 × 15 / 26 = Rs. 86,538.46</strong></p>
            <h3>Key Factors of Gratuity</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Your gratuity cannot exceed Rs. 10 lakh, with any amount above
                this considered <strong>ex gratia.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                For work periods beyond 5 years, fractions like 17 years and 6
                months will be rounded off to 18 years.
              </li>
            </ul>

            It uses the following formula for gratuity under the Payment of
            Gratuity Act, 1972: (Last Drawn Salary × 15 × Years of Service) ÷
            26.<br />
            Here: Last Drawn Salary includes basic pay and dearness allowance
            (DA). Tenure of Service is the total number of years worked (rounded
