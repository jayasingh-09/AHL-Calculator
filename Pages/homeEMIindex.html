    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The credit market in India is steadily on the rise.</p>
    <p>
        It is currently the 4th largest credit industry in the world, recording a CAGR of over 11% year on year. A vast majority of these advances are short-term credits such as personal loans and credit cards. Combined, these two financial products account for 78% of all credit lending in India. Loan repayments include EMIs, and borrowers should consider the EMI amount to accurately plan their current and future finances.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several EMI calculators available online; one must choose an accurate <strong>EMI calculator</strong> and learn its usage to calculate the exact EMI amount they are liable to pay for a loan.
    </p>
    <h3>Factors Affecting Your Due Amount</h3>
    <p>
        There are certain factors you need to consider while planning for applying for a loan. Based upon your financial and repayment capacity, you will be required to calculate equated monthly installments (EMI). Here are a few factors to consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Term of the Loan</strong>
            <p>
                A loan’s tenure may get reduced or extended. Subsequently, there will be an increase or a decrease in the EMI amount as well. Thus, considering the term of a loan is also an important factor that may affect your due amount.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rate of Interest</strong>
            <p>
                The rate of interest is a vital factor that will help to assess the installment amount owed. You can compare the product and opt for one which has a lower rate of interest so that your overall repayment stays low.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Amount of Loan</strong>
            <p>
                Choosing the loan amount is another significant factor for determining your EMI. Based on the loan amount you choose, your equated monthly installment will be calculated accordingly.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How can an online EMI calculator help you?</h3>
    <p>
        The number of credit accounts is growing at an even higher CAGR of 28% and has reached 107 million accounts at the end of FY18.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of the type of loan you want to avail of, be it a secured or unsecured advance, it is paramount that you know how much monthly installment you have to make before you avail it. That is where an <strong>EMI calculator in India</strong> can be immensely helpful.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It helps you get an accurate estimate of your EMI amount so that you can plan your finances accordingly. Make sure that your debt-to-income ratio is below 50% to maximize your chances of loan approval.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <strong>loan EMI calculator</strong> helps you save valuable time. You don’t have to do complex calculations manually, which can be quite time-consuming.
        </li>
        <li>
            It eliminates any chance of a miscalculation, providing you with an accurate estimate every time.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is highly specific for each type of loan. The EMI breakup of a home loan, for example, is different from that of a personal loan.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The formula to determine loan EMI amount</h3>
    <p>
        There is a specific formula that Groww uses to compute the EMI amount for a loan:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>EMI = [P x R x (1+R) ^N] / [(1+R) ^ (N-1)]</strong>, where –
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>P is the principal amount</li>
        <li>R is the rate of interest</li>
        <li>N is the loan tenure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is the standardized formula used by any <strong>online loan calculator</strong>. Some variables may be added based on the type of loan.
    </p>
    <h3>Types Of EMI Calculator</h3>
